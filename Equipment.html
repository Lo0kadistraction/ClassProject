    <h1>
        Equipment used for competitive shooting
    </h1>
    <p>
        When discussing the Equipment used in competitive shooting the conversation can become very nuanced. Because of this I am going to list some basic gear and requirements to get started. If you already own a firearm there is a division for you. Once you get started in competitive shooting and learn the ropes you can make an informed decision of what division you would enjoy competing in. For purposes of this webpage I will first list what you are required to have in both sports. Then I will briefly describe the requirements for all divisions. If you are not interested in that you can just read the basic requirements and then go have fun.
