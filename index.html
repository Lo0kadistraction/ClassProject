        My name is Christopher McMinn, but I prefer to go by CJ. I currently work in the Air Force as a Crew Chief and I have worked on a few different aircraft during my time.
        I recently moved to Shaw, AFB in South Carolina, which in turn assigned me to an F-16 Squadron. Prior to this change, I was on the U-2S Spy Plane and the A-10C Attack aircraft.
        I created this page to give some information about my favorite hobby competitive shooting and how i got started into it and some things I hae learned along the way to help others

    </P>

        How I got started in competitive shooting

    <P>
        <!--Paragraph two -->
        I have more hobbies than I can afford! But currently, I am spending the most of my time and money on competitive shooting in the United States Pistol Association (USPSA).
        I enjoy this hobby because it requires a lot of skill and there is an athletic element to it. However, in the past I have dabbled in skateboarding, woodworking, snowboarding,
        motocross, sport bikes, racecars, RC planes, programing microcontrollers, and computer gaming. Unfortunately, my wallet cannot afford all of these at one time so I must make some
        sacrifices to be able to enjoy something.
