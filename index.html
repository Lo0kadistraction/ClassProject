			Welcome to my page!

		<P> <!--Paragraph one-->
			My name is Christopher McMinn, but I prefer to go by CJ. I currently work in the Air Force as a Crew Chief and I have worked on a few different aircrafts during my time. 
			I recently moved to Shaw, AFB in South Carolina, which in turn assigned me to an F-16 Squadron. Prior to this change, I was on the U-2S Spy Plane and the A-10C Attack aircraft. 
			My major is in computer programming and I am about halfway done with it! I have decided to pursue this as my major because 
			I constantly have the thought that there is an easier, a better, or a more efficient way to complete a task. 
			For example, someone can turn a manual task into a task that can be completed with a simple mouse click, just by writing some code.

			Hobbies
		</h3>
		<P><!--Paragraph two -->
			I have more hobbies than I can afford! But currently, I am spending the most of my time and money on competitive shooting in the United States Pistol Association (USPSA). 
			I enjoy this hobby because it requires a lot of skill and there is an athletic element to it. However, in the past I have dabbled in skateboarding, woodworking, snowboarding, 
			motocross, sport bikes, racecars, RC planes, programing microcontrollers, and computer gaming.Unfortunately, my wallet cannot afford all of these at one time so I must make some 
			sacrifices to be able to enjoy something.
